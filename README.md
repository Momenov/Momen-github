# Bikeshare Project

## Date created

This project and README file were created on [26th August 2024].

## Description

This project analyzes bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities—Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C.—to explore trends in bike usage, such as the most popular times for bike rentals, trip duration, and user demographics. The goal is to identify patterns that can provide insights into how bikeshare services are utilized in these cities.

## Files used

- bikeshare.py: The main Python script that performs the data analysis and allows users to filter data by city, month, and day of the week.
- Data Files: CSV files containing bikeshare data for Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C. (These files are excluded from version control using a .gitignore file).
